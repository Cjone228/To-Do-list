This repository contains a simple, browser-based To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to:

Add new tasks to a list.
Mark tasks as completed by toggling a "checked" state.
Remove tasks from the list.
Save tasks automatically using localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
This project is a great starting point for learning basic web development concepts and working with the DOM and localStorage in JavaScript.

Features:
Minimalistic and user-friendly interface.
Persistent task management with localStorage.
Dynamic task creation, deletion, and state toggling.
